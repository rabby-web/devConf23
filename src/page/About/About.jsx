              Each year, 8,000+ developers, engineers, software architects, dev
              teams, managers, and executives from 70+ countries gather for
              DeveloperWeek (Feb 21â€“23, 2024, San Francisco Bay Area & Feb
              27-29, 2024, Virtual) to discover the latest in developer
              technologies, languages, platforms, and tools. DeveloperWeek 2024
              is the largest developer conference & event series including the
              DeveloperWeek 2024 Conference & Expo, 1,000+ attendee hackathon,
              800+ attendee tech hiring expo, and a series of workshops,
              technical talks, and keynotes. Because DeveloperWeek covers all
              new technologies, our conference and workshops invite you to get
              intro lessons (or advanced tips and tricks) on technologies like
              VR Dev, Artificial Intelligence Dev, Blockchain Dev, IoT Dev,
              Serverless technology, Microservices technology, new JavaScript
              frameworks, and more. This year, DeveloperWeek will have an
              expanded DevExec World, which is 2 days of roundtable talks,
              educational talks, and networking events for engineering managers,
              tech executives, and lead developers. Additionally, DeveloperWeek
              will be co-located with ProductWorld and CloudWorld.
